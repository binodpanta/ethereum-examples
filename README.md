# ethereum-examples

A collection of examples I built which I hope will come in handy for developers working on Ethereum Dapps

## deploying/ : Deploying contracts using Truffle
[This example](./deploying/) shows how to setup a simple Truffle application to deploy contracts to a running Ethereum net


## predeployed-contracts-mist/: Viewing Truffle-deployed contracts in Mist
[This example](./predeployed-contracts-mist/) shows how to view / load pre-deployed contracts in Mist, if they have been deployed by Truffle already
